To count the number of bars from both the original and zoomed-in images, look for the icon representing bars, which is typically a martini glass or another relevant symbol.

By counting each bar icon present in both images, we have:

1. Quick Coin One
2. Momofuku Noodle Bar
3. Tacos Morelos Taverna
4. Beron
5. Sidewalk Cafe
6. Tarallucci e Vino
7. Joe & P. Real Estate and Ferns
8. Stickett Inn
9. Faburamaus Fanny's Duo NYC
10. Graffiti
11. Rai Rai Ken

It appears there are 11 bars on the map.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. 11
