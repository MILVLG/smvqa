To determine the number of transportation facilities on the map, we examine the original image and the zoomed-in sub-image for any elements indicating transportation infrastructure such as bus stops, bike stations, or subway stations. 

From the images, we can identify the following transportation facilities:

1. A bus stop on East 14th Street across 1st Avenue near the bus icon.
2. A bus stop on East 14th Street at 1st Ave (north side).
3. A bus stop on East 14th Street at 1st Ave (south side).
4. Another bus stop further east on East 14th Street (near Avenue A).
5. Another bus stop on East 14th Street at Avenida.

Thus, the total number of transportation facilities counted is 5.

Therefore, the answer is:
A. 5
