To determine the number of health and beauty shops on the map, I will look for symbols and labels that typically indicate such establishments, such as scissors (for barbershops), bottles (for beauty products stores), or other relevant icons.

Upon examining both images:

1. The original image shows a wider area, including more streets and potential health and beauty shops.
2. The cropped image shows a zoomed-in area that highlights some of these shops more clearly.

From the examination, the following health and beauty-related shops can be identified:
- Mark Barber Shop
- Truffle Tree
- S&MAC Community Fridge
- Quick Coin One
- Eye & Health
- Black Seed Bagels
- Animsa
- Crystals Gardens - NYC

Count of health and beauty shops from both images combined:
Mark Barber Shop
Truffle Tree
S&MAC Community Fridge
Quick Coin One
Eye & Health
Black Seed Bagels
Animsa
Crystals Gardens - NYC

This results in a total of 8 distinct health and beauty shops identified.

Based on the given options:
A. 18
B. 14
C. 10
D. 13

None of the exact options fit exactly. However, based on the visual counts and detailed inspection, other icons in the original image also tally in the context of health & beauty but less identified in the cropping image,
hence potentially the correct match would adhere further towards estimated closest option,
which aligns
FALSE
