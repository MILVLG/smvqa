To determine the number of bars in the images, I will identify the establishments marked with icons typically used for bars (often represented by a beer mug or cocktail glass).

From the cropped sub-image, which zooms in on a segment of the map, I can see the following bars:

1. The Immigrant
2. Holiday Cocktail Lounge
3. Double Down
4. Little King's Craft Beer
5. Bua
6. Louis 649
7. Goodnight Sunny
8. Village East
9. Saint Dymphna
10. Otto's Shrunken Head
11. Barcade

Therefore, the number of bars visible in the sub-image is 11.

The correct answer is:
D. 11
