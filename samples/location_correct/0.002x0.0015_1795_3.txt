The sub-image gives a detailed view of the area around Village Farm Grocery. 

Village Farm Grocery is located on the left side of the sub-image at 150 2nd Avenue. Numero 28 is not visible in the sub-image, so we need to refer to the original map. 

In the original image, Numero 28 is located at 176 2nd Avenue, which is north of East 11th Street, while the Village Farm Grocery is located at 150 2nd Avenue, which is just south of East 10th Street.

Thus, Numero 28 is located towards the top-right direction (north) from Village Farm Grocery.

A. top-right
