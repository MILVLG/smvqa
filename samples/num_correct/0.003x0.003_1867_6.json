  "answer": "D",
  "inference": "To determine the number of apparel and accessories shops on the map, we need to look for icons or labels that indicate such shops. Here is what I found:\n\n1. **Eyes on 14th** - Lenses, frames, and other accessories related to eyewear.\n2. **Joe\u2019s Custom Tailors & Dry Cleaning** - Tailoring services (apparel related).\n3. **L&M Uniform** - Uniform store (apparel related).\n4. **H&R Handbags & Accessories** - Shop that sells handbags and accessories.\n\nFrom the map, I can only identify 4 shops related to apparel and accessories.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options (8, 2, 5, 3) matches exactly 4. However, the closest to 4, there would be 3.\n\nSo the answer is:\nD. 3",
