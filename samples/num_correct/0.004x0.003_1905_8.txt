The zoomed-in sub-image shows a smaller section of the original map, which contains three bars: Vazacs Horshoe Bar, Horses, and Oda House.

However, because the question asks for the total number of bars in the entire map (original image), we need to consider all bars in the full map. Upon examining the entire original map, I can identify the following bars:

1. Vazacs Horshoe Bar
2. Horses
3. Oda House
4. Bar Uni
5. Double Down
6. Ace Bar
7. Dream Baby
8. Mamaâ€™s Bar
9. Niagara

Hence, the total number of bars in the image is 9.

So, the correct answer is:
C. 9
