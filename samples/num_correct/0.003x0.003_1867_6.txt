To determine the number of apparel and accessories shops on the map, we need to look for icons or labels that indicate such shops. Here is what I found:

1. **Eyes on 14th** - Lenses, frames, and other accessories related to eyewear.
2. **Joeâ€™s Custom Tailors & Dry Cleaning** - Tailoring services (apparel related).
3. **L&M Uniform** - Uniform store (apparel related).
4. **H&R Handbags & Accessories** - Shop that sells handbags and accessories.

From the map, I can only identify 4 shops related to apparel and accessories.

Therefore, none of the given options (8, 2, 5, 3) matches exactly 4. However, the closest to 4, there would be 3.

So the answer is:
D. 3
